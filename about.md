Hello -- welcome to some of my thoughts.

### Brief bio

I have a PhD in Machine Learning (2004) (before it was cool) and then spent >15 years in academia (as a post doc / lecturer / senior lecturer) at the University of Glasgow. In 2021, I switched career and now work within a Business Intelligence team at NHS National Services Scotland. Usual disclaimer: anything on this page is my opinion, and not the opinion of NHS NSS.

I'm interested in all aspects of data science (not restricted to ML / AI), and how sensible use of data can provide value (particularly within healthcare). 

If my writing volume here is in any way correlated with my thinking, then also expect a lot of posts about cricket.
