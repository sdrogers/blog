Last week the Guardian published an article about the need for the UK to invest in its own GPT tech -- BritGPT. You can read it [here](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/22/uk-needs-its-own-britgpt-or-will-face-an-uncertain-future-mps-hear).

The argument goes that if the UK doesnt invest in Large Language Model (LLM) technology, then we'll be left behind. I'm not sure I agree with this. It may turn out that LLMs have large applications across society and it may not. We've seen impressive demos (and eye-opening failures) but translating this into reliable safe services is going to be really hard -- all we have so far is hype. But my main issue here is that it feels impossible to competitively enter the LLM race, given the level of investment that would be required, and the extremely limited pool of expertise that could be tapped into (worldwide) -- where would we get the people to do this?

We do have excellent broad academic ML capacity in the UK. Maybe investment would be better used in funding them to do foundational work that might put us at the front of the next wave, rather than chasing the current shiny thing? And, while we're at it, giving those academics freedom to direct that research as the people best placed to predict which direction(s) are most likely to lead to the next big thing.
